      Designing, developing, and testing HTML emails is one hell of a process, and that's why it's better to outsource it. But you know what else is hella hard as well? Finding a contractor that delivers a quality product on time who never disappears and is always there for revisions.<br/><br/>

With Potion Labs, you won't suffer from ghosting no more. (I can't promise the same result for your personal life) Request as many new tasks as you want with no additional cost. And keep your in-house web developers happy. (We all know how much they hate out-of-nowhere HTML email tasks)
